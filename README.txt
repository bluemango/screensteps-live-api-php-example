PHP example files for interfacing with your ScreenSteps Live account using the ScreenSteps Live API. 
Uses PHP, curl and the Crypt_HMAC PEAR package. Looks for HMAC.php file in same directory as 
sslive_class.php file. If not found then requires that file be in PEAR repository.

The Crypt_HMAC PEAR package is available at http://pear.php.net/package/Crypt_HMAC.
